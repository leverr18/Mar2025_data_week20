This project uses a logistic regression model to classify loans as either healthy (0) or high-risk (1) based on multiple features. The model is trained on a dataset and evaluated using performance metrics such as confusion matrix, precision, and recall to determine how well it distinguishes between healthy and high-risk loans.

Overall, the model performs well with high classification accuracy, though further improvements could be made to better capture the high-risk class.
